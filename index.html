            <h3><b>Early Life</b></h3>
            <p>Nathan John Feuerstein was born in Gladwin, Michigan, on March 30, 1991. He is the eldest of three and has two sisters. His parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother until his father had to take him away when her boyfriend abused him and one of his sisters. His mother died from an overdose of opioids in 2009, which led to him dedicating the song "How Could You Leave Us" to her. He graduated from Gladwin High School in 2009, and was on the school's basketball team. NF started his career at the Fine Arts Festival organized by Connection Church in Canton, Michigan.</p>

                <p>
                  Feuerstein has credited Eminem as his prime influence in hip hop, claiming that at one point that was all he listened to. Feuerstein has also credited Adele and Ed Sheeran as influences to his music style and instrumental components.[36] NF's style has also been compared to Logic and Machine Gun Kelly. Although he found his musical upbringing in Christian hip-hop, Feuerstein has denied his label as a Christian rapper, saying "I'm a Christian, but I don't make Christian music. You're not going to reach everyone with just one point of view. I write about things I'm actually dealing with. You don't have to be Christian to relate to them."[37]
          
          In 2013, Feuerstein appeared on Christian hip-hop artist Flame's album Royal Flush on the track "Start Over". In 2015, his features on TobyMac's This Is Not a Test track "Til the Day I Die" and Marty's Marty For President track "The One With My Friends" gained him fame and recognition in the Christian hip-hop genre. Feuerstein's 2017 collaboration with Futuristic, "Epiphany", enhanced his career in the secular hip hop industry.
